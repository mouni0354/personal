Step-1:

# wget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.58/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.58.zip

# unzip apache-tomcat-8.5.58.zip

Step-3:
#  mv apache-tomcat-8.5.58 tomcat

if you want to access tomcat from your browser we need some changes.

# vi webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml

	:se nu
	:20   (move to line number 20)
	Add this expression |.* end of the line      allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1|.*" />   (That means u r giving access to manager and manager-gui, (access a service called Host-manager from any n/w from IPv4 and IPV6 ))

# vi webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

	Save and quite (:wq)
	
Step-5:

# cd /opt/tomcat/conf

# vi tomcat-users.xml

	:se nu
